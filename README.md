### [Omega](https://omegaclassrooms.ga/ "Omega Classrooms") is a collaborative classroom platform for teachers and students alike.

The front end is built using [Alvin Wang (Dogfalo)'s](https://github.com/Dogfalo "Alvin Wang (Dogfalo)") CSS framework called [Materialize](https://github.com/Dogfalo/materialize "Materialize") which is based on material design principles.

The backend uses a LAMP(Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP) stack running on an [AWS EC2](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/ "AWS EC2") instance.
